50 days of python code

I found a Python 50 Days of Code challenge - mostly beginner stuff - as I ramp up my skill set with Python.

Hopefully you find this to be helpful if you're new like me. If you're a seasoned vet, please feel free to comment away and help me become a better programmer.

Thanks!
